## About the project
In this project I was given data from a drug trial in mice for different cancer treatments. 
Using Pandas and Matplotlib I anaslysed the data and visualised it to make it more presentable and increase its effectiveness as a communicational, rhetorical and informative tool. 

### Analysis

- 49 percent of the mice were Female and 51 percent were male.
- Average tumor volume is correlated with the weight of the mouse with a R2 value of 0.84.
- Capomulin & Ramicane reduced had the smallest tumours by the end of the experiment.
- Infubinol was the only drug to have a mouse that was considered a statistical outlier with a final tumour size of 35.32 mm3
